# Critical Design Concepts

## Scratch Area
- [ ] Addiction
- [ ] Privacy social networks
- [ ] Audio as threat vector: lead to misclassification
- [ ] Self replication?
- [ ] haptics (web tracking feedback)
- [ ] internet background radiation (as EMR)
- [ ] Side channel attacks
- [ ] Social media competes for attention in a zero sum game --- one innovation leads others to copy cf Schelling's hockey helmet

### ATM Mixer

An ATM with a pool of bills. You can deposit money and it will pay you back in fresh bills from its pool or give you an IOU that you can redeem later from any machine. When the holdings in a machine exceed its float, you pay a fee to take an IOU. When the holdings are depleted beyond the float, you pay a fee to cash out an IOU.

_Remarks:_ Literal money laundering. Fees should be included. (Maker / Taker)

### Vending Machine

Offers selections of goods. Instead of payment, you provide a fingerprint, personal information, password to account, etc.

_Remarks:_ Derived from study where people traded passwords for chocolate bars

### Dynamic Laughtrack

Digital television content, such as sitcoms, encode laughtracks as a series of cues rather than an actual recording. Smart TVs listen and classify the viewer's level of laughter on a 10 point scale (with fine grain training over time). The TV adds laughter to the content in a sensitive and considerate manner, where the laughtrack is only marginally higher on the scale than the viewer's own laughter. This gently nudges the viewer to greater enjoyment of the program without bombarding her. It also mixes in actual past recordings of the viewer's own laughter to capitalize on emotional mirroring.

_Remarks:_ derived from Alexis/Homepod design

### Sneezing laptop

This laptop is equipped a small nozzle positioned beside the webcam which “sneezes” when the user opens an attachment to an email. It serves to remind the user of this most common vector for computer virus transmission. Since the user prefers to orient the screen to gaze directly into the screen, the sneeze tends to reach her face. The sneeze consists of water, routed from a refillable container under the laptop. When empty, a water level sensor alerts to the operating system to not allow the email client to be opened.

_Remarks:_ Inspired by Attenborough’s Gesundheit radio which sneezes out dust to invoke animal behaviour. Malware spread through email is well documented.

### USB rejector

This laptop is equipped with an apparently functional usb port however should a device be inserted into the port, five audible clicks will be heard followed by the connector’s physical projection from the port. An internal mechanism loads a spring upon the insertion on the usb connector, which requires more force than usual but does not require on-board power to operate.  

_Remarks:_ Could be simplified to just taping over the usb port so seems pointless.

### Levity patch

A software patch for Alexis or Homepod that parses the environment for human sounds and classifies them based on emotion. While the deep learning algorithm is under active development for distinguishing complex emotions, it is generally reliable for extreme emotions — such as laughing and crying. The levity patch will record laughter and replay it at moments of detected sadness to add levity to the moment.

Remarks: Predecessor to dynamic laughbox and subsumed by it
