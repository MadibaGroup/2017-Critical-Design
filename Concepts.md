# Critical Design Concepts

## Scratch Area
- [ ] Addiction
- [ ] Audio as threat vector: lead to misclassification
- [ ] internet background radiation (as EMR)
- [ ] Side channel attacks
- [ ] Social media competes for attention in a zero sum game --- one innovation leads others to copy cf Schelling's hockey helmet
- [ ] Smart mirrors reflect enhanced you

###

An approach employed by social networks to increase engagement, Style Shift learns cues for when a user is about to browse away, such as the hail Mary scroll, etc. It cools the color of the page to reengergize the user.

subtly changes the color of the website's elements, fonts, and the tint of embedded images to a bluer tones.

Nightshift social networks, engagement

### Physical Traceroute

When browsing the internet, insecure traffic filters through multiple nodes – each of which might inspect the data, log it, filter it, or modify it. Physical traceroute is an app for a smart watch or other wearable device with haptic feedback. As the user browses sites, the watch sends vibration pings to the user signifying the number of nodes the traffic flows through, with the duration increasing slightly if the node is located within other geographic borders. The user may be concerned that country-internal data flows over borders or delighted when HTTPS traffic results in no pings.

_Remarks:_ UToronto work showing NSA boxes.

### ToS Fishing

A website-based game for hunting down long terms of service agreements from websites. Users simply copy and paste the URL of the terms of service. If the ToS has been seen before, they are awarded points based on its word count. If it has not been seen before, it is reviewed by a human for validity and word count—and in this case, the user gets a bonus. To mitigate people from launching custom websites, the game only accepts sites from the Alexis top million. Users display their aggregate score, a mantle with their top catches (word count but not websites are publicly displayed), and various badges for playing consistently.

### Wifi Projector

Minimalist wifi routers, such as Apple's airport (extreme), have a single light indicating with color (red, orange and green) internet connectivity. This understates the interesting and intriguing data flowing through the device. By contrast, the wifi projector is a talkative router that projects onto the ceiling above where it is placed a plethora of information, configurable by the owner. The default setting will display a set of icons for each user with a connected device and the list of the most recently visited websites (by domain) for each user. The noisy view will include all the clutter of ads, tracking, and content management that is queried when visiting a typical website, while the pristine view will use human-curated blacklists to limit the display to the primary domain the user is visiting.

_Remarks:_ Serves to remind the surveillance potential of a router. Also can expose the extent of tracking.

### ATM Mixer

An ATM with a pool of bills. You can deposit money and it will pay you back in fresh bills from its pool or give you an IOU that you can redeem later from any machine. When the holdings in a machine exceed its float, you pay a fee to take an IOU. When the holdings are depleted beyond the float, you pay a fee to cash out an IOU.

_Remarks:_ Literal money laundering. Fees should be included. (Maker / Taker)

### Free Samples

In the style of a vending machine, a user may provide a fingerprint of blood from which her genome is sequenced. The machine will then dispense sample products to the user: for example, cigarettes for dopamine receptor gene, supplements for brac1/2. Since DNA is unique, the system tracks which products have been dispensed so that a single user does not drain the machine of all their entitlements. The user may also enrol their address for a welcome package.

_Remarks:_ Related to study where people traded passwords for chocolate bars.

### Dynamic Laughtrack

Digital television content, such as sitcoms, encode laughtracks as a series of cues rather than an actual recording. Smart TVs listen and classify the viewer's level of laughter on a 10 point scale (with fine grain training over time). The TV adds laughter to the content in a sensitive and considerate manner, where the laughtrack is only marginally higher on the scale than the viewer's own laughter. This gently nudges the viewer to greater enjoyment of the program without bombarding her. It also mixes in actual past recordings of the viewer's own laughter to capitalize on emotional mirroring.

_Remarks:_ derived from Alexis/Homepod design

### Sneezing laptop

This laptop is equipped a small nozzle positioned beside the webcam which “sneezes” when the user opens an attachment to an email. It serves to remind the user of this most common vector for computer virus transmission. Since the user prefers to orient the screen to gaze directly into the screen, the sneeze tends to reach her face. The sneeze consists of water, routed from a refillable container under the laptop. When empty, a water level sensor alerts to the operating system to not allow the email client to be opened.

_Remarks:_ Inspired by Attenborough’s Gesundheit radio which sneezes out dust to invoke animal behaviour. Malware spread through email is well documented.

********************************

### USB rejector

This laptop is equipped with an apparently functional usb port however should a device be inserted into the port, five audible clicks will be heard followed by the connector’s physical projection from the port. An internal mechanism loads a spring upon the insertion on the usb connector, which requires more force than usual but does not require on-board power to operate.  

_Remarks:_ Could be simplified to just taping over the usb port so seems pointless.

### Levity patch

A software patch for Alexis or Homepod that parses the environment for human sounds and classifies them based on emotion. While the deep learning algorithm is under active development for distinguishing complex emotions, it is generally reliable for extreme emotions — such as laughing and crying. The levity patch will record laughter and replay it at moments of detected sadness to add levity to the moment.

Remarks: Predecessor to dynamic laughbox and subsumed by it
