# Ideation Methodology

Prompt: 



We are trying to come up with examples of "critical design" that illustrate issues in the areas of security, privacy, algorithmic bias, fairness, transparency, or other related subjects. The deliverable will be a short description of the design. I will give a few examples of critical designs and their descriptions (although these are not necessarily critical in terms of security and privacy).

Compass Table: by A. Dunne and F. Raby
``This table reminds you that electronic objects extend beyond their visible limits. The 25 compasses set into its surface twitch and spin when objects like mobile phones or laptop computers are placed on it. The twitching needles can be interpreted as being either sinister or charming, depending on the viewer's state of mind. When we designed the compass table, we wondered if a neat-freak might try to make all the needles line up, ignoring the architectural space of the room in favour of the Earth's magnetic field.'' 

Life Counter by I. Matsumoto 
``With Life Counter (2001), you choose how many years you would like to or expect to live for and start the counter. Once activated, it counts down the selected time span at four different rates: the number of years, days, hours or seconds to go are shown on different faces. Depending on which face you choose to display, you may feel very relaxed as the years stretch out ahead or begin to panic as you see your life speed away before your eyes. The counter is designed to be visually unassuming and could easily fit into the slightly retro-futuristic style of the moment.'' 

Open Informan by J Ardern, Y. Ushigome and A. Jain
``Open Informant (2013) takes the form of a networked object including a phone app and e-ink badge. The app searches your communications for National Security Agency trigger words and then sends text fragments containing these words to the badge worn by the user for public display. Using the body as an instrument for protest, the badge becomes a means of rendering our own voice visible in an otherwise faceless technological panopticon.''

Question: The first step in our design methodology is to generate "HMW" questions that will help us come up with new critical designs. Can you suggest around 10 HMWs that you think would be helpful for us?
