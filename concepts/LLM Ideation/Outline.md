# Ideation Methodology

Prompt: 

We are trying to come up with examples of "critical design" that illustrate issues in the areas of security, privacy, algorithmic bias, fairness, transparency, or other related subjects. The deliverable will be a short description of the design. I will give a few examples of critical designs and their descriptions (although these are not necessarily critical in terms of security and privacy).

Compass Table: by A. Dunne and F. Raby
``This table reminds you that electronic objects extend beyond their visible limits. The 25 compasses set into its surface twitch and spin when objects like mobile phones or laptop computers are placed on it. The twitching needles can be interpreted as being either sinister or charming, depending on the viewer's state of mind. When we designed the compass table, we wondered if a neat-freak might try to make all the needles line up, ignoring the architectural space of the room in favour of the Earth's magnetic field.'' 

Life Counter by I. Matsumoto 
``With Life Counter (2001), you choose how many years you would like to or expect to live for and start the counter. Once activated, it counts down the selected time span at four different rates: the number of years, days, hours or seconds to go are shown on different faces. Depending on which face you choose to display, you may feel very relaxed as the years stretch out ahead or begin to panic as you see your life speed away before your eyes. The counter is designed to be visually unassuming and could easily fit into the slightly retro-futuristic style of the moment.'' 

Open Informan by J Ardern, Y. Ushigome and A. Jain
``Open Informant (2013) takes the form of a networked object including a phone app and e-ink badge. The app searches your communications for National Security Agency trigger words and then sends text fragments containing these words to the badge worn by the user for public display. Using the body as an instrument for protest, the badge becomes a means of rendering our own voice visible in an otherwise faceless technological panopticon.''

Question: The first step in our design methodology is to generate "HMW" questions that will help us come up with new critical designs. Can you suggest around 10 HMWs that you think would be helpful for us?



---

Here are some HMWs that we found most useful. Can you consider them and suggest 10 more. Do not reword the exiting ideas, but suggest new ideas that are not covered well by these. 

* **HMW get the reader to think new thoughts about security/privacy/etc? ðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µ**

* **HMW create a quick process to test and iterate the vignette? ðŸ”µðŸ”µ**

* **HMW give interesting names to our designs? ðŸ”µðŸ”µ**

* **HMW use popular story structures (e.g., The hero's journey, three-act structure) to create variation and interest,but also provides the narrative with some structured elements, such as the order of events. ðŸ”µðŸ”µ**

* **HMW avoid repetition in the designs or avoid "sink holes" of a bunch of designs being the sameðŸ”µðŸ”µ**

* **HMW give interesting names to our designs? ðŸ”µðŸ”µ**

* **HMW use humour, satire, irony, and absurdity in critical designs to critique certain issues ðŸ”µðŸ”µ**

* **HMW draw inspiration from other sources (TV shows, books, films) such as dystopian books like 1984, Brave New World, and shows like Black Mirror, Love Death and Robots****

  **ðŸ”µðŸ”µ**

* **HMW: Start with the deliverable, break it into components, and then think about developing each component**

* **HMW come up with a procedure, tool etc that will help us to create scenarios based on ideation cards, prompts or "stems"? ðŸ”µ**

* **HMW we identify the best narrative structure(s) for critical designs (the vignette) (ex: describe design, narratives, climax). ðŸ”µ**

* **HMW: Learn from speculative fiction, security fiction ðŸ”µ**

* **HMW explore aspects of security or privacy that are overlooked by the users so that focus on these aspects in our designs? ðŸ”µ**

* **HMW break the mold of past work and make the project our own? ðŸ”µ**

* **HMW ensure our "designs" are actually designs and consist with design principles? ðŸ”µ**

* **HMW give the narratives more relevance to what people care about**

  **and relatable ðŸ”µ**

  **HMW make the critique intuitive and between the lines of what we say, rather than a lecture?**

  **ðŸ”µ**

  **HMW make designs that are "sticky" and readers will remember after, say, 1 week of reading the paper? ðŸ”µ**
