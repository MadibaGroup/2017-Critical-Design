* Analysed different methods of design (divergent, convergent, mapping prototyping)
* How might we? : starting from the general problem statment, each of has created HMW cards. We also tried ChatGPT for those cards.

  * Grouped the HMW cards around similar topics
  * Dot voting to determine the most imporatant questions
* Inspiration board: we gathered images, news,concepts etc that reminded us of the project/inspired us
* We took the sticky notes (ideation cards) created previously, grouped them under themes, added new cards (w and w/o help of ChatGPT)
* We converted themes into cards

  * We came up with 5 suits for ideation cards (Critical, design, scenario, narrative, stickiness)
  * We decided to keep two suits: critical and design and distributed the themes across these two options 
  * Some suites can serve as a "checklist" for a quality check for the designs created (to be determined later).
* We divided the themes among ourselves so that each of us had cards from each suit (critical and design). Then we each created ideation cards based on the theme with the format: title + description
* We "tested" the cards. Each of us drew one card from each suit and came up with a design. We repeated this to see how we draw cards (keep drawing 2 cards until we find an idea, keep the one we like and continue drawing friom the other suit etc.), whether the combinations lead to ideas.
* Then each of us looked at all of the cards to either present alternatives to the card content itself (changes regarding the title and/or the description) or we suggested to keep them as is.
* We also merged/unmerged cards, discussed whteher the card is a good fit for its suit.
* We applied the MoSCoW method to determine the most important, relevant cards to keep in the deck.
* March 5, 2025: We started to go over each ideation card to finalize them (decide whether to keep a card, refine the description and the title, choose among the alternatives of the same card)
* We decided on a "final" set of cards after several iterations on the cards (which involved merging, deleting, moving the cards between the two categories, rewording): 37 critique and 30 design cards.
* May 14, 2025: we decided to conduct an autoethnography  
* May 21, 2025: we decided on what to report for each diary entry and created the required fields in the form. We decided to record 4 entries each until our next meeting.
* May 28, 2025: After 4 days of recorsing diary entries for the auto ethnography, we discussed how it went. We polished the form that has the sections of our diary and merged the fields that we found redundant. We also added new fields: ChatGPT transcript, option to upload an image, how long it took to come up with the design. We also discussed different ways of interacting with ChatGPT: use the prompt we have (the one with the previous designs as examples), talking about the cards drawn first and then designing. We talked about differetn ways of experimenting with the design process: using ChatGPT or not, how we interact with it (we let it come up with the design, try to extract ideas only etc), narrative style (following the "template" we have, how to improve the narrative, or try something other than the template...).
* June 9, 2025:
  * We clarified some questions we had about the auto ethnography. For the cards used field, we'll write only the ones we used but explain in the resflections section, whether we drew more cards and decided to use a subset fo them. 
  * We also discussed what is the goal of this process: find the optimal promt that will generate a good critical design? Create a 5-star design independent of the way we interact with ChatGPT (or without it)? 
  * We should also reflect on the things we tried and didn't work (a prompt, drawing cards in the morning and thinking about them whole day and taking down notes, creating the design in one session, coming up with he name of the design first, limit yourself to the first two cards you've drawn, use both cards, use only one of them etc.) 
  * Another goal is testing the cards: do they work, in which combination, ideal number of cards for coming up with a design...
  * How long the autoethnography will take? If we think that we start to use the same patterns during the design process, we can stop and try also other things. We all thought that we can continue making designs.
  * Some common criticisms we had about the process that the design sometimes lacked plausibility, had a preachy tone, sometimes the prompt generated answers more than what we wanted (like explanations, analysis of the design)
  * We are also experimenting wiht the narrative style.We followed this "template" in most of our designs:  describe, why the design is liked, what goes wrong. But we also tried creating a narrative only design, news, an ad for a design, meme, images etc.
  * We can also have "challenges": to create 5-star designs only (not a design a day but it may take longer to polish the design to have 5-star rating), draw two cards on Monday and create 5 designs using the same cards during the week (another version: all three of us use the same two cards)
  * At the end of the process we can rank all of our designs (using dot voting for insatance). Why we liked them? Which component is strong? (Name, plausibility, creativity etc.)
  * We decided to co-design all together in the next meeting.
