* Analysed different methods of design (divergent, convergent, mapping prototyping)

* How might we? : starting from the general problem statment, each of has created HMW cards. We also tried ChatGPT for those cards.

  * Grouped the HMW cards around similar topics
  * Dot voting to determine the most imporatant questions

* Inspiration board: we gathered images, news,concepts etc that reminded us of the project/inspired us

* We took the sticky notes (ideation cards) created previously, grouped them under themes, added new cards (w and w/o help of ChatGPT)

* We converted themes into cards

  * We came up with 5 suits for ideation cards (Critical, design, scenario, narrative, stickiness)
  * We decided to keep two suits: critical and design and distributed the themes across these two options 
  * Some suites can serve as a "checklist" for a quality check for the designs created (to be determined later).

* We divided the themes among ourselves so that each of us had cards from each suit (critical and design). Then we each created ideation cards based on the theme with the format: title + description

* We "tested" the cards. Each of us drew one card from each suit and came up with a design. We repeated this to see how we draw cards (keep drawing 2 cards until we find an idea, keep the one we like and continue drawing friom the other suit etc.), whether the combinations lead to ideas.

* Then each of us looked at all of the cards to either present alternatives to the card content itself (changes regardign the title and/or the description) or we suggested to keep them as is.

* We also merged/unmerged cards, discussed whteher the card is a good fit for its suit.

* We applied the MoSCoW method to determine the most important, relevant cards to keep in the deck.
