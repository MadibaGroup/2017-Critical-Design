### No(i)sy elevator

Everyone hates elevator music xxx. This is why employees will be happier riding the noisy elevator. When it recognizes a user, it spins up a selection from their most-played songs on major music streaming platforms. Alice finds hearing her favourite Miles Davis song grounds her at the start of each work day, while Bob and Carol, coincidently riding the elevator together, discover they share a love for Lady Gaga. David is a bit more concerned about the profanity ridden banger that the nosy elevator selects in front of his superiors.
