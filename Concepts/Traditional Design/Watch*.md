# Anxiety watch





Bob loves to wear his new smart watch that tracks his anxiety level throughout the day. Little did he know that his watch could exchange signals over Bluetooth with other smart watches revealing his anxiety levels to the people he meets. When Alice realizes that Bob's anxiety level increased just after they start talking, she mentions it to Bob, causing him to feel embarrassed.
