# ToS Fishing

A website-based game for hunting down long terms of service agreements from websites. Users simply copy and paste the URL of the terms of service. If the ToS has been seen before, they are awarded points based on its word count. If it has not been seen before, it is reviewed by a human for validity and word countâ€”and in this case, the user gets a bonus. To mitigate people from launching custom websites, the game only accepts sites from the Alexis top million. Users display their aggregate score, a mantle with their top catches (word count but not websites are publicly displayed), and various badges for playing consistently.
