### Free Samples

In the style of a vending machine, a user may provide a fingerprint of blood from which her genome is sequenced. The machine will then dispense sample products to the user: for example, cigarettes for dopamine receptor gene, supplements for brac1/2. Since DNA is unique, the system tracks which products have been dispensed so that a single user does not drain the machine of all their entitlements. The user may also enrol their address for a welcome package.
