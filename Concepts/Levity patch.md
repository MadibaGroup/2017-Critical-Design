### Levity patch

A software patch for Alexis or Homepod that parses the environment for human sounds and classifies them based on emotion. While the deep learning algorithm is under active development for distinguishing complex emotions, it is generally reliable for extreme emotions â€” such as laughing and crying. The levity patch will record laughter and replay it at moments of detected sadness to add levity to the moment.

Remarks: Predecessor to dynamic laughbox and subsumed by it
