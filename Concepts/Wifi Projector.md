### Wifi Projector

Minimalist wifi routers, such as Apple's airport (extreme), have a single light indicating with color (red, orange and green) internet connectivity. This understates the interesting and intriguing data flowing through the device. By contrast, the wifi projector is a talkative router that projects onto the ceiling above where it is placed a plethora of information, configurable by the owner. The default setting will display a set of icons for each user with a connected device and the list of the most recently visited websites (by domain) for each user. The noisy view will include all the clutter of ads, tracking, and content management that is queried when visiting a typical website, while the pristine view will use human-curated blacklists to limit the display to the primary domain the user is visiting.

_Remarks:_ Serves to remind the surveillance potential of a router. Also can expose the extent of tracking.
