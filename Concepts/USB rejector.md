### USB rejector

This laptop is equipped with an apparently functional usb port however should a device be inserted into the port, five audible clicks will be heard followed by the connectorâ€™s physical projection from the port. An internal mechanism loads a spring upon the insertion on the usb connector, which requires more force than usual but does not require on-board power to operate.  

_Remarks:_ Could be simplified to just taping over the usb port so seems pointless.
