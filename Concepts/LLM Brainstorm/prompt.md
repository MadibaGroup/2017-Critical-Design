We are trying to come up with concepts based on "Critical Design" that highlight the risks and dangers in cybersecurity, privacy, algorithmic fairness, and other related issues.  We would like to explain you our design process before we ask for your help. 

First we came up with a list of concepts that can serve as the main idea for the design (like the main message it gives). We call it the "message list":

1. User Fatigue
2. Hiding in plain sight
3. Security through obscurity
4. AI hallucinations
5. Crime and privacy
6. Presumed security
7. Privacy paradox
8. I have nothing to hide
9. Disclosed data will be run on the algorithms of the future
10. Can’t undo data disclosure
11. If you don’t pay for the product, you are the product
12. Least privilege
13. Minimal Disclosure
14. STRIDE
15. Different rules online than offline
16. Anonymity sets
17. Being watched changes your behaviour
18. Project a behaviour online to offline setting
19. Creating dilemmas
20. Embedding human bias into algos (visualize this?)(Weapons of Math Destruction Cathy O’Neil)
21. Data has a social life (personify data?)
22. Present users/machines as victims
23. Change the regular design medium to an unexpected one (ex: audio to visual)
24. Folk models of privacy
25. Attenuate disturbing UI elements
26. Show a counterfactual
27. Everyone else is doing it
28. Right to be Forgotten
29. Data is extension of your body

Then, we created a list of media that will be used in the design. They will be the type of data used in the design. We call it the "medium list":

1. Social Networks
2. Contact Tracing
3. ID
4. Permissions (apps, cookies, etc)
5. Targeted Advertising
6. Passwords
7. Finances
8. Location
9. Genomics
10. Health Records

The third list we determined is a list of form factors. The design uses one of these devices/environments to convey it message. We call it the "form factor list":

1. Smart TV
2. AR Device
3. Siri / Google Home / Alexis
4. Chat AI
5. Fitness tracking devices
6. Smart Phones
7. Print out
8. Lights
9. Anthropomorphism
10. Medical metaphors
11. Chatbot (human-like)
12. Data doubles (Self tracking - Gina Neff)
13. Facial Recognition
14. Haptics

We also have list of emotions that we want our design to evoke. It is about how the users would respond to this design. Here is the "response list":

1. Funny
2. Embarrassing
3. Scary
4. Anger
5. Surprising/Startling
6. Sad
7. Contemplative
8. Amusing 
9. For kids
10. Memes

Then we randomly picked one item from each list and wrote a paragraphe-long scenario that based on the chosen items from each list. So, could you randomly pick one item from those lists (one from each: message list, medium list, form factor list and response list) and write a paragraph-long scenario?
