### Physical Traceroute

When browsing the internet, insecure traffic filters through multiple nodes â€“ each of which might inspect the data, log it, filter it, or modify it. Physical traceroute is an app for a smart watch or other wearable device with haptic feedback. As the user browses sites, the watch sends vibration pings to the user signifying the number of nodes the traffic flows through, with the duration increasing slightly if the node is located within other geographic borders. The user may be concerned that country-internal data flows over borders or delighted when HTTPS traffic results in no pings.
