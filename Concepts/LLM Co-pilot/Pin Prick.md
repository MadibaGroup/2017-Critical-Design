# Pin Pricks

In the style of a vending machine, a user may provide a fingerprint of blood from which her genome is sequenced. The machine will then dispense sample products to the user: for example, cigarettes for dopamine receptor gene, supplements for brac1/2. Since DNA is unique, the system tracks which products have been dispensed so that a single user does not drain the machine of all their entitlements. The user may also enrol their address for a welcome package.

_Remarks:_ Related to study where people traded passwords for chocolate bars.

What if there were a more reliable CAPTCHA that detects you are really a human? Pin-prick CAPTCHA is just designed for this. Whenever you need to prove that you are not a robot on a website, the device connected to your computer performs a pin-prick blood test.

Remark: Or it performs a genetic analysis to verify something (like the phenotypical properties you've provided)? When and why will it do that? I think we also noted down the narrative of hacking it, but I can't remember what we talked about exactly. Also, is this disturbing, scary etc?
