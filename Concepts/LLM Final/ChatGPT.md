Prompt:

Crystal Avatars: Crystal avatars are created instantly but only gets better over time. At first, they are not recognizable and cannot be differentiated from other users, but as users browse the site, small details crystallize. Alice is happy to save time registering for the site and have a personal avatar, which automatically added a cat accessory after she spent a lunch hour reading about hairball treatments. However she grows uneasy about the "Woman, Life, Freedom" badge, a cause she believes in but only vocalizes discriminately. 

Chatty: The latest software update for Alice's voice-activated home assistant Chatty adds machine learning to better infer Alice's commands, such as adding items to her shopping list and suggesting music she might like. It does not always know whether Alice is talking to it or not, so over time it picks up on pieces of Alice's life and has trouble unlearning them. Alice is startled but pleased when Chatty chimes in with the name of `that actor who was in that thing' she was telling her friend about. She is bemused to find cleaning spray on her shopping list after she said her research chair smells fishy. 

Dynamic Laughtrack: Digital television content, such as sitcoms, encode laughtracks as a series of cues rather than an actual recording. Smart TVs listen and classify the viewer's level of laughter on a 10 point scale (with fine grain training over time). The TV adds laughter to the content in a sensitive and considerate manner, where the laughtrack is only marginally higher on the scale than the viewer's own laughter. This gently nudges the viewer to greater enjoyment of the program without bombarding her. It also mixes in actual past recordings of the viewer's own laughter to capitalize on emotional mirroring.

No(i)sy elevator: Elevator music has never been regarded as elevating your mood. This is why employees will be happier riding the noisy elevator. When it recognizes a user, it spins up a selection from their most-played songs on major music streaming platforms. Alice finds hearing her favourite Miles Davis song grounds her at the start of each work day, while Bob and Carol, coincidently riding the elevator together, discover their shared love for 90s britpop. David is a bit more concerned about the profanity ridden banger that the nosy elevator plays for him and his boss.

Receiver plant: The receiver plant in the front yard of Alice records the information of the people that pass by. It is a greedy plant that needs to absorb enough bluetooth data to grow. Bob is singlehandedly responsible for its lustrous canopy from walking by Alice's house every day, mostly while checking his work emails on his phone. Perhaps the plant overstepped when it displayed, "you are 15 minutes late today, are you sure you can make it to work on time?"

Response:

Transparent Wallet
Alice's digital wallet automatically categorizes her purchases and shares anonymized spending habits on a public leaderboard. She enjoys seeing her eco-friendly purchases earning her top marks in the green consumer category. However, Alice is troubled when she notices ads for luxury items appearing more frequently after her high spending months are tracked and shared by the wallet.

Echo Chamber Filter
A social media app uses an advanced algorithm to filter content to match users' perceived political views and biases. At first, Alice appreciates the streamlined news feed with content she agrees with. Over time, she realizes her interactions are limited to a narrow worldview, reinforcing her existing beliefs and making it difficult to encounter differing perspectives or engage in meaningful discussions.

Emotion Tracker Wearable
Alice’s smartwatch not only tracks her physical activity but also monitors her emotional states through heart rate variability and other biomarkers. The app suggests activities to boost her mood when she’s down. One day, Alice notices her insurance premium has increased. She discovers the data from her wearable has been shared with her insurance company, indicating high stress levels, which they consider a risk factor.

Algorithmic Hiring Bot
Alice's company uses an AI-driven bot to screen job applications and conduct initial interviews. The bot, trained on historical data, tends to favor candidates with backgrounds similar to existing employees. This results in a homogeneous workplace lacking diversity. Alice starts questioning the fairness of the hiring process when a highly qualified candidate she referred is rejected without a clear reason.

Smart Mirror
Alice's smart mirror provides personalized skincare recommendations and tracks changes in her appearance over time. It uses facial recognition to analyze her emotions and suggest products to improve her mood. One day, Alice notices the mirror suggesting makeup products she dislikes. She realizes the mirror has been selling her data to cosmetic companies, leading to targeted ads that influence her purchasing decisions.
