# Chatty*

The latest software update for Alice's voice-activated home assistant Chatty adds machine learning to better infer Alice's commands, such as adding items to her shopping list and suggesting music she might like. It does not always know whether Alice is talking to it or not, so over time it picks up on pieces of Alice's life and has trouble unlearning them. Alice is startled but pleased when Chatty chimes in with the name of `that actor who was in that thing' she was telling her friend about. She is bemused to find cleaning spray on her shopping list after she said her [research chair] smells fishy. 



[says expression with food reference and finds it added to her shopping list].
