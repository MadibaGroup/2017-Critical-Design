### Sneezing laptop

This laptop is equipped a small nozzle positioned beside the webcam which “sneezes” when the user opens an attachment to an email. It serves to remind the user of this most common vector for computer virus transmission. Since the user prefers to orient the screen to gaze directly into the screen, the sneeze tends to reach her face. The sneeze consists of water, routed from a refillable container under the laptop. When empty, a water level sensor alerts to the operating system to not allow the email client to be opened.

_Remarks:_ Inspired by Attenborough’s Gesundheit radio which sneezes out dust to invoke animal behaviour. Malware spread through email is well documented.
