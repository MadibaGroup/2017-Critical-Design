## Pin-Prick CAPTCHA

What if there were a more reliable CAPTCHA that detects you are really a human? Pin-prick CAPTCHA is just designed for this. Whenever you need to prove that you are not a robot on a website, the device connected to your computer performs a pin-prick blood test.

Remark: Or it performs a genetic analysis to verify something (like the phenotypical properties you've provided)? When and why will it do that? I think we also noted down the narrative of hacking it, but I can't remember what we talked about exactly. Also, is this disturbing, scary etc?
