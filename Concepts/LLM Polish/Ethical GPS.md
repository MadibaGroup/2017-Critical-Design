# Ethical Navigator Concept



## Original

### Ethical Navigator

**Concept**: A GPS navigation app that not only provides directions but also highlights the ethical considerations of various routes, such as passing through areas with known privacy risks or surveillance hotspots. **Story**: Dave likes using the Ethical Navigator to avoid high-surveillance areas. However, he feels frustrated when it consistently suggests longer routes to avoid neighborhoods with dense security camera networks, making him late for appointments and questioning the balance between privacy and convenience.

## After polish

**Civic Compass**: Civic Compass is an add-on for popular GPS navigation apps that highlights the ethical considerations of various routes, such as avoiding surveillance hotspots or environmentally protected habitats. Public policy debates have emerged over the app's potential abuse by criminals. When Alice is in a rush, she ignores its suggestions. She is also disturbed to see that most of the surveillance hotspots are in impoverished, marginalized neighborhoods.
