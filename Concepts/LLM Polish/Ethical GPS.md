# Ethical Navigator Concept



Original

## Ethical Navigator

**Concept**: A GPS navigation app that not only provides directions but also highlights the ethical considerations of various routes, such as passing through areas with known privacy risks or surveillance hotspots. **Story**: Dave likes using the Ethical Navigator to avoid high-surveillance areas. However, he feels frustrated when it consistently suggests longer routes to avoid neighborhoods with dense security camera networks, making him late for appointments and questioning the balance between privacy and convenience.
