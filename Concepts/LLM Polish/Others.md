**Privacy Cloak**: A wearable device that masks a user's identity from digital surveillance systems. It scrambles facial recognition data and blocks location tracking, offering a sense of anonymity. However, its use can draw suspicion, and it might be banned in certain areas, leading to a societal debate on the balance between privacy and security.



**Privacy Pulse**: An app that visualizes Alice's privacy exposure in real-time, showing how much of her personal data is being accessed and by whom. The constant notifications about data breaches and unauthorized access attempts make Alice hyper-aware of her vulnerability, leading to increased stress and paranoia about her digital security.



**Reputation Radar**: An app that continuously scans the web for mentions of Alice's name, compiling a detailed report of her online reputation. While this helps Alice stay informed about her digital presence, she becomes anxious when she discovers that the app is also accessible to potential employers and acquaintances, who may judge her based on incomplete or biased information.
