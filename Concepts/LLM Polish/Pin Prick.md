## BloodKey

BloodKey is a form of two-factor authentication that can protect online accounts from stolen passwords. With BloodKey, after providing their password, users authenticate with a pin-prick blood test using an inexpensive biomedical Bluetooth gadget. BloodKey was quickly adopted by leading websites because it was very hard to fake, despite its invasive nature. However, Alice grew tired of the daily inconvenience of pricking her finger, so she gradually stopped logging into her social media accounts altogether, while Bob's medical condition prevented him from using it at all. A media frenzy ensued when the most popular free-to-play online game sold users' genomic data to pharmaceutical companies, boosting their revenue streams.
