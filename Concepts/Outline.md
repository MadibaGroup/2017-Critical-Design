# Common Prompt

We are trying to come up with concepts based on "Critical Design" that highlight the risks and dangers in cybersecurity, privacy, algorithmic fairness, and other related issues. First we would like to just show you some examples before we ask for your help.

Crystal Avatars: Crystal avatars are created instantly but only gets better over time. At first, they are not recognizable and cannot be differentiated from other users, but as users browse the site, small details crystallize. Alice is happy to save time registering for the site and have a personal avatar, which automatically added a cat accessory after she spent a lunch hour reading about hairball treatments. However she grows uneasy about the "Woman, Life, Freedom" badge, a cause she believes in but only vocalizes discriminately. 

Chatty: The latest software update for Alice's voice-activated home assistant Chatty adds machine learning to better infer Alice's commands, such as adding items to her shopping list and suggesting music she might like. It does not always know whether Alice is talking to it or not, so over time it picks up on pieces of Alice's life and has trouble unlearning them. Alice is startled but pleased when Chatty chimes in with the name of `that actor who was in that thing' she was telling her friend about. She is bemused to find cleaning spray on her shopping list after she said her research chair smells fishy. 

Dynamic Laughtrack: Digital television content, such as sitcoms, encode laughtracks as a series of cues rather than an actual recording. Smart TVs listen and classify the viewer's level of laughter on a 10 point scale (with fine grain training over time). The TV adds laughter to the content in a sensitive and considerate manner, where the laughtrack is only marginally higher on the scale than the viewer's own laughter. This gently nudges the viewer to greater enjoyment of the program without bombarding her. It also mixes in actual past recordings of the viewer's own laughter to capitalize on emotional mirroring.

No(i)sy elevator: Elevator music has never been regarded as elevating your mood. This is why employees will be happier riding the noisy elevator. When it recognizes a user, it spins up a selection from their most-played songs on major music streaming platforms. Alice finds hearing her favourite Miles Davis song grounds her at the start of each work day, while Bob and Carol, coincidently riding the elevator together, discover their shared love for 90s britpop. David is a bit more concerned about the profanity ridden banger that the nosy elevator plays for him and his boss.

Receiver plant: The receiver plant in the front yard of Alice records the information of the people that pass by. It is a greedy plant that needs to absorb enough bluetooth data to grow. Bob is singlehandedly responsible for its lustrous canopy from walking by Alice's house every day, mostly while checking his work emails on his phone. Perhaps the plant overstepped when it displayed, "you are 15 minutes late today, are you sure you can make it to work on time?"

Calm Watch: Calm Watch is a smart watch that tracks anxiety levels based on several biomarkers. When the anxiety level of the wearer crosses a threshold, a haptic vibration pulse prompts the user to look at the watch. From there, they can select a variety of calming techniques, including breathing exercises and guided meditation. Bob is nervous to talk to Alice and becomes flustered when his watch starts vibrating mid-conversation, just loud enough for Alice to hear it and notice his fidgeting with the watch.

Wifi Projector: Minimalist wifi routers have a single light indicator to show internet connectivity, such as a green light as opposed to red light. This understates the interesting and intriguing data flowing through the device as users browse the internet. By contrast, the wifi projector is a talkative router that projects visualizations onto the ceiling above where it is placed. Every website that pulls in scripts and cookies from other domains is displayed as a constellation of stars of various colours and sizes, which slowly fade away. While Alice's visit to dictionary.com is a beautiful galaxy, she is also perturbed by the number of ads and tracking companies surveilling her.

ToS Fishing: ToS Fishing is a digital game where players earn points by hunting down excessive legalese on websites, including terms of service (ToS), privacy policies, and cookie policies. To play, users simply copy and paste the URL of the legalese. If the ToS has been seen before, the users are awarded points based on its word count. If it has not been seen before, it is reviewed by a human for validity and word countâ€”and in this case, the user gets a finder's bonus. To mitigate people from launching custom websites, the game only accepts sites from the Alexis top million. Users display their aggregate score on a leaderboard with a profile showing their top catches (word count only, not the website), and can earn various badges for playing consistently.

Eleventh Finger: Biometric authentication based on fingerprints is generally user-friendly and fast. Eleventh finger is a 3D printed rubber finger, customized with the user's fingerprint. You can put it on a keychain and use it on cold winter days when you do not want to remove your gloves. Alice lets her friend Bob borrow it when he stays at her house. It can also serve as a backup if the worst happens.

GOTTCHA: GOTTCHA is a human-detection system to protect online accounts being accessed by bots. It invokes the device camera to analyze if a live human is using the device. To protect against video replays or machine-generated video, it unexpectedly prompts the user with a randomly selected image and carefully measures their reaction to it. Micro-expressions are involuntary facial displays of emotion that are too fast to mimic artificially. GOTTCHA's image bank can provoke disgust, anger, fear, sadness, happiness, surprise or contempt. Over time, Alice stops visiting websites that use GOTTCHA because of its capricious tendency to mix in disturbing images.
