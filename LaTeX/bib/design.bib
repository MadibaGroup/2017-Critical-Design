	abstract = {Critical design is a research through design methodology that foregrounds the ethics of design practice, reveals potentially hidden agendas and values, and explores alternative design values. While it seems to be a timely fit for today's socially, aesthetically, and ethically oriented approaches to HCI, its adoption seems surprisingly limited. We argue that its central concepts and methods are unclear and difficult to adopt. Rather than merely attempting to decode the intentions of its originators, Dunne and Raby, we instead turn to traditions of critical thought in the past 150 years to explore a range of critical ideas and their practical uses. We then suggest ways that these ideas and uses can be leveraged as practical resources for HCI researchers interested in critical design. We also offer readings of two designs, which are not billed as critical designs, but which we argue are critical using a broader formulation of the concept than the one found in the current literature.},

Drawing on methods from speculative design, this paper presents an improvisational role-playing game designed to help software developers identify security threats. It deploys this game with seven software developers, who used the game to successfully identify diverse threats in their software. The insights from this deployment motivate future work on both the game itself and on organizational accounts of security. I call on the design research community to continue to apply its methods and perspectives to computer security, locating threat identification itself, like all speculation, as a site of social and political power.},

This paper draws on critical practice and speculative design to explore, question and problematise the ultimate consequences of such technology using the quantification of companion animals (pets) as a case study. We apply the concept of "moving upstream" to study such technology and use a qualitative research approach in which both pet owners, and animal behavioural experts, were presented with, and asked to discuss, speculative designs for pet quantification applications, the design of which were extrapolated from contemporary trends. Our findings indicate a strong desire among pet owners for technology that has little scientific justification, whilst our experts caution that the use of technology to augment human-animal communication has the potential to disimprove animal welfare, undermine human-animal bonds, and create human-human conflicts. Our discussion informs wider debates regarding quantification technology.},

We analyze the designs through lenses of Environment, Data Privacy, Embodiment, and Play. This trip into the future is driven by the research question: how might generative AI tools change how we produce creativity and culture? When we return to the present, we ask ourselves, how might generative AI support positive outcomes for individuals and communities? Can we predict (and potentially mitigate) negative consequences of generative AI tools? The speculative designs purposefully engage viewers in futures thinking to reclaim conversation around the future of technology.},

Yet, designers often get fixated on specific problems, solutions, or trivial surface details without considering the bigger system and the intricate relationships within. Previous works demonstrated how suggesting relevant design examples can help designers break out of fixation. However, current systems recommend design ideas that are decontextualized from other relevant design information. As a result, designers need to manually maintain key relationships and context during the design process. DesignNet is a system to explicitly model the inter-relationships between design information with a knowledge graph. Future work will investigate whether and how a knowledge graph representation and associated graph algorithms can support computational creativity and guide design exploration.},

Through interviews, observations, and a user survey, we present a sampling of the artistic styles and describe the developed community of practice around generative AI. We find that: 1) artists hold the text prompt and the resulting image can be considered collectively as a form of artistic expression (prompts as art), and 2) prompt templates (prompts with “slots” for others to fill in with their own words) are developed to create generative art styles. We discover that the value placed by this community on unique outputs leads to artists seeking specialized vocabulary to produce distinctive art pieces (e.g., by reading architectural blogs to find phrases to describe images). We also find that some artists use “glitches” in the model that can be turned into artistic styles of their own right. From these findings, we outline specific implications for design regarding future prompting and image editing options.},

As co-creative AI is a form of intelligent technology that directly involves humans, it is critical to anticipate and address ethical issues during all design stages. The open-ended nature of human-AI interactions in co-creation poses many challenges for designing ethical co-creative AI systems. Researchers have been exploring ethical issues associated with autonomous AI in recent years, but ethics in human-AI co-creativity is a relatively new research area. In order to design human-centered ethical AI, it is important to understand the perspectives, expectations, and ethical concerns of potential users. In this paper, we present a study with 18 participants to explore several ethical dilemmas and challenges in human-AI co-creation from the perspective of potential users using a design fiction (DF) methodology. DF is a speculative research method that depicts a new concept or technology through stories as an intangible prototype. We present the findings from the study as potential users’ perspectives, stances, and expectations around ethical challenges in human-AI co-creativity as a basis for designing human-centered ethical AI partners for human-AI co-creation.},

Our findings suggest that TTI generation is a recreational activity mainly conducted by narrow socio-demographic groups who use auxiliary techniques across platforms and beyond request-response interactions. Inherent model limitations and finding suitable prompt formulation are the main obstacles practitioners face. A taxonomy and a corresponding ML model capable of recognizing the semantic content of unseen prompts were created to conduct the user prompt analysis. The prompt analysis revealed that artist names are the main specifier used beside the main subject, often in sequences. We finally discuss the design and socio-technical implications of our work for creativity support.},

The findings point to three main themes, including i) the practical usefulness and limitations of the system in design ideation processes, ii) how the form of user interaction shapes users’ expectations of the system’s capabilities and potentials, and iii), how the broader discourse around AI both limits and enables how co-creative processes involving human and AI unfolds. The discussion outlines design implications and alternative framings of this kind of co-creative design practices based on post-human perspectives on design and technology use.},

However, creating metaphors for science writing is challenging even for professional writers; according to our formative study (n=6), finding inspiration and extending metaphors with coherent structures were critical yet significantly challenging tasks for them. We contribute Metaphorian, a system that supports science writers with the creation of scientific metaphors by facilitating the search, extension, and iterative revision of metaphors. Metaphorian uses a large language model-based workflow inspired by the heuristic rules revealed from a study with six professional writers. A user study (n=16) revealed that Metaphorian significantly enhances satisfaction, confidence, and inspiration in metaphor writing without decreasing writers’ sense of agency. We discuss design implications for creativity support for figurative writing in science.},

A preliminary study identified specific issues in composing and fine-tuning prompts, as well as needs in accurately translating intentions into rich input. We developed DesignPrompt, a moodboard tool that lets designers combine multiple modalities — images, color, text — into a single GenAI prompt and tweak the results. We ran a comparative structured observation study with 12 professional designers to better understand their intent expression, expectation alignment and transparency perception using DesignPrompt and text input GenAI. We found that multimodal prompt input encouraged designers to explore and express themselves more effectively. Designer’s interaction preferences change according to their overall sense of control over the GenAI and whether they are seeking inspiration or a specific image. Designers developed innovative uses of DesignPrompt, including developing elaborate multimodal prompts and creating a multimodal prompt pattern to maximize novelty while ensuring consistency.},

In our interviews, we investigated creators’ production process and challenges in creating short-form videos. In participatory workshops, short-form video creators envisioned AI-powered video tools, addressing their requirements and AI collaboration perceptions. Our findings indicate ASVGs can provide various advantages including inspiration, swift access to video sources, and automated highlight generation. To put things in perspective, we also underscore concerns arising from AI collaboration, including potential creator identity dilution, reduced creative output, and information bubble. We also discuss design considerations when designing ASVG to retain their creative values.},

In contrast, AI-powered design tools often employ a linear sequence of incremental and precise instructions to approximate design objectives. Such operations violate customary creative design practices and thus hinder AI agents’ ability to complete creative design tasks. To explore better human-AI co-design tools, we first summarize human designers’ practices through a formative study with 12 design experts. Taking graphic design as a representative scenario, we formulate a nonlinear human-AI co-design framework and develop a proof-of-concept prototype, OptiMuse. We evaluate OptiMuse and validate the nonlinear framework through a comparative study. We notice a subconscious change in people’s attitudes towards AI agents, shifting from perceiving them as mere executors to regarding them as opinionated colleagues. This shift effectively fostered the exploration and reflection processes of individual designers.},

News outlets aim to reach audiences through news reels—short videos conveying news—but struggle to translate traditional journalistic formats into short, entertaining videos. To translate news into social media reels, we support journalists in reframing the narrative. In literature, narrative framing is a high-level structure that shapes the overall presentation of a story. We identified three narrative framings for reels that adapt social media norms but preserve news value, each with a different balance of information and entertainment. We introduce ReelFramer, a human-AI co-creative system that helps journalists translate print articles into scripts and storyboards. ReelFramer supports exploring multiple narrative framings to find one appropriate to the story. AI suggests foundational narrative details, including characters, plot, setting, and key information. ReelFramer also supports visual framing; AI suggests character and visual detail designs before generating a full storyboard. Our studies show that narrative framing introduces the necessary diversity to translate various articles into reels, and establishing foundational details helps generate scripts that are more relevant and coherent. We also discuss the benefits of using narrative framing and foundational details in content retargeting.},

We argue that current generative modeling tools lack critical features that would make them useful creativity support tools, and introduce our own tool, generative.fashion1, which was designed with theoretical principles of design space exploration in mind. Through qualitative studies with fashion design apprentices, we demonstrate how generative.fashion supported both divergent and convergent thinking, and compare it with a state-of-the-art text-based interface using Stable Diffusion. In general, the apprentices preferred generative.fashion, citing the features explicitly designed to support ideation. In two follow-up studies, we provide quantitative results that support and expand on these insights. We conclude that text-only prompts in existing models restrict creative exploration, especially for novices. Our work demonstrates that interfaces which are theoretically aligned with principles of design space exploration are essential for unlocking the full creative potential of generative AI.},

This paper examines the burgeoning area of AI art to understand how artists incorporate ML in their creative work. Drawing upon related HCI theories, we investigate how artists create ambiguity by analyzing nine AI artworks that use computer vision and image synthesis. Our analysis shows that, in addition to the established types of ambiguity, artists worked closely with the ML process (dataset curation, model training, and application) and developed various techniques to evoke the ambiguity of processes. Our finding indicates that the current conceptualization of ML as a design material needs to reframe the ML process as design elements, instead of technical details. Finally, this paper offers reflections on commonly held assumptions in HCI about ML uncertainty, dependability, and explainability, and advocates to supplement the artifact-centered design perspective of ML with a process-centered one.},

Our design probe, DreamSheets, supports user-composed exploration strategies with LLM-assisted prompt construction and large-scale simultaneous display of generated results, hosted in a spreadsheet interface. Two studies, a preliminary lab study and an extended two-week study where five expert artists developed custom TTI sheet-systems, reveal various strategies for targeted TTI design space exploration—such as using templated text generation to define and layer semantic “axes” for exploration. We identified patterns in exploratory structures across our participants’ sheet-systems: configurable exploration “units” that we distill into a UI mockup, and generalizable UI components to guide future interfaces.},

The results revealed that personalized avatars in the transparent system were viewed less positively than customized avatars in the transparent system or avatars in the nontransparent system. These avatars appeared less comfortable and honest in their self-disclosure and less competent. Interestingly, avatars in the nontransparent system attracted more followers.

To identify these values and attitudes, we conducted an interview study with 18 authors across eight genres (e.g., poetry, comics) by presenting speculative but realistic AI-bridged CLA scenarios. We identified three benefits derived from the dynamics between author, artifact, and audience: those that 1) authors get from the process, 2) audiences get from the artifact, and 3) authors get from the audience. We found how AI-bridged CLA would either promote or reduce these benefits, along with authors’ concerns.

The LLM participated by instructing two participants who executed its instructions and provided objective feedback, generated ideas autonomously and made all design decisions without human intervention. The LLM exhibited similar prototyping practices to human participants and finished second among six teams, successfully designing and providing building instructions for functional prototypes. The LLM's concept generation capabilities were particularly strong. However, the LLM prematurely abandoned promising concepts when facing minor difficulties, added unnecessary complexity to designs, and experienced design fixation. Communication between the LLM and participants was challenging due to vague or unclear descriptions, and the LLM had difficulty maintaining continuity and relevance in answers. Based on these findings, six recommendations for implementing an LLM like ChatGPT in the design process are proposed, including leveraging it for ideation, ensuring human oversight for key decisions, implementing iterative feedback loops, prompting it to consider alternatives, and assigning specific and manageable tasks at a subsystem level.},

	abstract = {Families and youth often interact with artificial intelligence (AI) and are stakeholders in technology. However, while AI can enhance interactions with technology, it is well-known that AI can also be biased and cause harm. Therefore, AI literacy is important, such that users understand both some technical components (e.g., training data, what is and is not AI and why), as well as ethical aspects (e.g., bias in society reflected in AI-powered technology) in order to make informed and empowered decisions about interacting with technologies. AI learning opportunities are scarce, and few leverage informal intergenerational learning as an opportunity for youth to engage with topics in AI and ethics. Games are an underexplored yet promising route for intergenerational play and learning for families and youth without much prior exposure to computing or AI. This talk highlights how and why games are particularly fitting to support families in gaining AI literacy through (1) games as an educational tool to build stronger mental models of AI, (2) intergenerational play as a way to scaffold adults and children in having a dialogue about more complex ethical considerations of AI, and (3) position families in roles of influence, where they may be empowered as techno-social change agents. We believe that games can help fill a gap by making AI literacy, an important family matter, accessible to a range of adult and youth learners.},

Lifelong learning environments are especially crucial for building AI literacy as they possess the ability to reach a larger audience and create opportunities for everyone to learn. This ongoing project aims at exploring the perception and understanding of AI by different members of the public (i.e., children, adults). In addition, it aims at promoting AI literacy among different groups of the public (e.g., educators, adults, elderly and children) through an open course and identifying the best practices for developing appropriate training activities for each group. As an initial step, a pilot study was conducted for investigating the response of the general public to a distance learning initiative and their educational needs for learning about AI. Results indicate that after attending a short course on AI, participants were able to understand and recognize what AI is, appreciate its positive and negative aspects, and most importantly, acknowledge the need for educating children and adults about AI. Finally, the results highlight that educating the general public about AI is a complex task that must be informed by further research. As a next step, questionnaires will be distributed in an attempt to understand how public perceive AI. Considering public's knowledge and understanding of AI, appropriate learning activities will be developed aiming to help different groups of the public to acquire the necessary skills related to AI literacy.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity are in-demand skills, but little is known about what factors influence computer science (CS) undergraduate students' decisions on whether to specialize in AI or cybersecurity and how these factors may differ between populations. In this study, we interviewed undergraduate CS majors about their perceptions of AI and cybersecurity. Qualitative analyses of these interviews show that students have narrow beliefs about what kind of work AI and cybersecurity entail, the kinds of people who work in these fields, and the potential societal impact AI and cybersecurity may have. Specifically, students tended to believe that all work in AI requires math and training models, while cybersecurity consists of low-level programming; that innately smart people work in both fields; that working in AI comes with ethical concerns; and that cybersecurity skills are important in contemporary society. Some of these perceptions reinforce existing stereotypes about computing and may disproportionately affect the participation of students from groups historically underrepresented in computing. Our key contribution is identifying beliefs that students expressed about AI and cybersecurity that may affect their interest in pursuing the two fields and may, therefore, inform efforts to expand students' views of AI and cybersecurity. Expanding student perceptions of AI and cybersecurity may help correct misconceptions and challenge narrow definitions, which in turn can encourage participation in these fields from all students.},

Hence, ML is a particularly important facet of ethics education so that models are less biased and more fair to all users. Natural Language Processing (NLP) specifically functions on text, a human produced artifact, making it more prone to inheriting flawed biases. However, teaching about ethics in ML courses is lacking. To address this issue, we created 3 interventions in an NLP course to introduce students to biases in ML models. We employed a combination of hands-on programming activities, lecture, and a project that discusses ML fairness at different levels and for different populations including gender bias and disability bias. Each intervention included a reflection question about bias. We also interviewed 6 students to further understand the impact of the interventions. The answers to the reflection questions and the interviews were qualitatively analyzed using inductive coding. We found that integrating fairness topics throughout the NLP course with repeated discussions led to an overall positive shift in students' attitudes and awareness towards ML fairness.},

Despite the impact of content moderation on public discourse and online experiences, the debate surrounding content moderation regulation rarely involves those impacted by these decisions. To explore how to engage individuals in learning opportunities that deepen understanding of social and technical aspects of online content moderation, we designed and tested an educational game: CONTENTR. The game gives participants experience debating and making decisions about platform governance. We used the Values at Play (VAP) game design framework to discover and translate social values into game elements, and then verified both values translation and learning outcomes using qualitative feedback from three phases of testing. We found that gameplay facilitated collaborative discussion and decision-making regarding the challenges of designing an online platform for mass appeal. Both tabletop and online versions of the game are available on our project website. Our findings highlight how gameplay can create a deeper understanding of the challenges involved in developing and enforcing online content policies, and challenge participants' pre-existing values and assumptions through both game elements and exposure to other participants' perspectives. We believe the game will be useful in courses ranging from civics and technology policy to information and computer science.},

To this end, we describe our efforts to design and implement a hands-on workshop for the public on smart-home security and privacy.Our workshop curriculum centers on the smart-home device lifecycle: obtaining, installing, using, and removing devices in a home. For each phase of the lifecycle, we present possible vulnerabilities along with preventative measures relevant to a general audience. We integrate a hands-on activity for participants to put best-practices into action throughout the presentation.We ran our workshop at a science museum in June 2023, and we used participant surveys to evaluate the effectiveness of our curriculum. Prior to the workshop, 38.8\% of survey responses did not meet learning objectives, 22.4\% partially met them, and 38.8\% fully met them. After the workshop, only 9.2\% of responses did not meet learning objectives, while 29.6\% partially met them and 61.2\% fully met them.

	abstract = {Metaphors are deeply embedded in the language of computing, from 'stacks' and 'queues' to 'trees' and 'handshaking'. Such metaphorical expressions not only shape but also fundamentally reflect our understanding and conceptualization of computing concepts. Students' descriptions of computing concepts have also been shown to be richly metaphor-laden, often framing abstract notions in more tangible or accessible ways. The rich metaphorical conceptualizations set the stage for a natural application of Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT) in computing education research. At its core, CMT posits that metaphors are not just linguistic expressions but fundamental structures of understanding, influencing how we perceive and think about the world.This work highlights the inherent congruence of traditional CMT analysis methods with computing education research contexts. We demonstrate this applicability via a case study that brings CMT into action, focusing on student-generated analogies from a CS1 course using a tailored CMT framework. The tailored approach employs analogical decomposition, to analyze both the target and source domain descriptions. While the case study presents a tailored CMT framework for analogies, this work retains broad relevance for understanding student conceptions using natural language data in which students describe computing concepts.},

Statistics were aggregated from a sample of one hundred CAE-C institutions, trends and gaps are identified, and improvements are proposed. The second source is peer-reviewed research published in the field of cybersecurity education over the last decade. A review of this literature shows a strong focus on identifying instructional content and developing educational tools while simultaneously indicating a shortage of research into rigorous evaluation of the instructional approaches being used to teach cybersecurity. Our review of these two sources of data highlight two paths to improving cybersecurity education in the United States. First, institutions offering cybersecurity degrees could work more closely with groups such as NIST, ACM, and IEEE to ensure their curricula match the needs of industry and they are graduating work-ready cybersecurity specialists. While CAE-C designation provides certain requirements for the amount of cybersecurity content included in curricula, designated institutions vary widely in the types of programs they offer and how many cybersecurity-specific courses they provide. Second, cybersecurity education could benefit from an influx of ideas from educational psychology regarding instructional theories such as cognitive load theory.},

Public and private initiatives have prioritized building a robust and qualified cybersecurity workforce, requiring student buy-in. However, cybersecurity education typically remains siloed even within computer and information technology (CIT) curriculum. This paper's goal is to support endeavors and strategies of outreach to encourage interest in cybersecurity. To this end, we conducted a survey of 126 CIT students to investigate student perceptions of cybersecurity and its major crosscutting concepts (CCs). The survey also investigates the prevalence of preconceptions of cybersecurity that may encourage or dissuade participation of people from groups underrepresented in computing. Regardless of prior learning, we found that students perceive cybersecurity as a relatively important topic in CIT. We found student perspectives on conceptual foundations of cybersecurity were significantly different (p \&lt; .05) than when simply asked about "cybersecurity," indicating many students don't have an accurate internal construct of the field. Several previously studied preconceptions of cybersecurity were reported by participants, with one misconception - that cybersecurity "requires advanced math skills" - significantly more prevalent in women than men (p \&lt; .05). Based on our findings, we recommend promoting cybersecurity among post-secondary students by incorporating elements of cybersecurity into non-cybersecurity CIT courses, informed by pedagogical strategies previously used for other topics in responsible computing.},

	abstract = {The evolution of the art of filmmaking is closely tied to technical innovation. From the earliest invention of the motion picture camera to the first use of stop motion and on to the development of techniques that use computers for modern-day visual effects, filmmaking has evolved through collaboration between art and science. Today, the visual effects industry uses computer science technology to bring worlds and galaxies to life. And yet many students are unaware that there are computer science careers within the media and entertainment industry. Encouraging this diverse group of talented computer scientists to enter the field not only gives students options in their careers but also strengthens this collaborative industry. Dr. Rachel Rose, Director of Research \&amp; Development at the storied visual effects company Industrial Light \&amp; Magic (ILM), will share her experience leading the development of software and hardware innovations that help artists bring film to life. Dr. Rose will also discuss the important role the Academy Software Foundation plays in maintaining a base of open source software for the industry that anyone can contribute to, including students. She will outline some of the outreach and education efforts within the Foundation that encourage students of diverse backgrounds to consider a career in the industry.},

	abstract = {As the building ages, the wall structure may become deteriorated (e.g., wall cracks, discontinuities, and corrosion) due to the variation of the environment (i.e., temperature and humidity). Moreover, these wall cracks, discontinuities, and corrosion will affect the living comfort and coziness. As such, the wall health diagnostic becomes crucial for the safety and comfort of modern buildings. However, the existing wall health detection techniques (e.g., UWB radars, acoustic sensing, and sensor embedding techniques) are high-cost, not ubiquitous, and not robust to the variation of the environment.In this article, we propose VibWall, a system that can use the smartphone’s sensors (i.e., accelerometer, gyroscope, and vibrator) to detect the wall’s structural health. Specifically, the wall cracks can be detected for living safety, comfort, and coziness. Our key idea is that the smartphone’s vibration is absorbed, reflected, and propagated disparately based on the physical structure of the wall. To be specific, we employ a novel challenge-response scheme, where the challenge is a sequence of heterogeneous vibration patterns from the smartphone’s vibrator, and the responses to these vibrations are sensed by the smartphone’s gyroscope and accelerometer sensors. Then, the machine learning-based classifier (e.g., random forest classifier) will be used to discriminate between the healthy wall and the wall with cracks, discontinuities, or corrosion based on these responses. Our experimental results show good performance on the wall’s structural health detection with the wall specimen and real-world walls.},

Narrative interviews were conducted with ten San who completed secondary school and ten who dropped out of school, to identify challenges and factors. Rich picture sessions with twelve primary learners were used to identify current challenges. Based on an in depth analysis of the local adversities, a mobile digital application was designed, deploying a role model approach with local content.

One component of air pollution is PM2.5, which accounts for around 80\% of deaths due to air pollution. Solutions for lowering PM2.5 levels in Delhi have been ineffective due to their unscientific design. In this article, we build a mixed-methods model that captures the interplay of various factors—geographical, chemical, meteorological—that contribute to the concentration of PM2.5. Using domain knowledge and KDE sampling from NASA’s GEOS-CF dataset, we identify the major sources of each of the seven constituents of PM2.5. From the 68 sources thus selected, we run the NOAA’s HYSPLIT wind dispersion model to track the movement of released particles to the sink, i.e., Delhi. Using the concentration of pollutants at the sources and by tracking their movement, we can predict the PM2.5 levels at the sink and identify polluting sources. Our model performed significantly better than the baseline fixed-effects model and captured seasonal variations in all seven constituents of PM2.5. It also uncovered the impact of polluting sources hundreds of kilometers away on the air of Delhi. Policymakers can use such a model to design data-driven policy interventions.},

We investigate why and in what contexts different categories of connected devices become disused by their owners; what owners value about their disused devices; and what they perceive to be the barriers to adopting circular practices, for example, by fixing, recycling, or reusing them. Our contribution is to provide a descriptive account of how functional, sentimental, and other values associated with devices shape owners’ perceptions and attitudes toward their “end of life,” for an expanded range of connected products. By highlighting how perceptions of concepts including convenience, ownership, and wastefulness mediate how owners approach the “end of life” of a device, we map the barriers for device owners to engage in more circular practices and highlight opportunities to address them through design. Our study replicates previous findings in the domain, as well as extending them, contributing to how the design of modern IoT devices leads to new barriers, opportunities, and considerations for more circular design.},

	abstract = {Human–vehicle interaction is an important factor for safe driving. The driver needs to interact with the in-vehicle steering wheel and infotainment system properly during driving. Specifically, driving guidelines require the driver to hold the steering wheel at the 3 o’clock and 9 o’clock positions. Moreover, the in-vehicle infotainment system should be more adaptive for the driver and front-seat passenger during driving (i.e., the in-vehicle infotainment system should be part and even fully disabled for the driver, whereas the front-seat passenger should be able to enjoy the full in-vehicle infotainment system). However, affordable vehicles are usually designed to achieve basic driving functions without considering safe human–vehicle interactions, which require an add-on, affordable, and ready-to-use human–vehicle interaction monitoring system.In this article, we present RFDrive, a system that can simultaneously locate the driver’s hand positions on the steering wheel and automate in-vehicle infotainment system touch discrimination for safe driving using commodity passive RFID tags. Since these commodity passive RFID tags are low cost (i.e., around 5 cents per tag), battery free, and are small, like a sticker, our design will enable not only safe driving but is also low cost, which can lead to sustainable solutions. To do so, we attach RFID tags on the steering wheel for the driver’s hand position location and attach RFID tags on the roof of the vehicle’s interior for in-vehicle infotainment system touch discrimination (i.e., differentiating the driver’s infotainment system touch and front-seat passenger’s infotainment system touch). However, the wheel steering will distort the wireless channel-based driver’s hand position location on the steering wheel. Thus, we propose a novel tag ID-based algorithm to locate the driver’s hand position on the steering wheel by harnessing the human body as part of the RFID tag’s antenna. Since the in-vehicle infotainment system touch from the driver or front-seat passenger will affect different RFID tags attached to the roof of the vehicle’s interior, we propose to use the differential amplitude of backscattered signals from all the tags to discriminate in-vehicle infotainment system touch sources. Our experiments show that RFDrive can achieve the average accuracy of 0.98 and 0.98 for in-vehicle touch source discrimination and driver’s hand position location, respectively.},

The study reveals drivers' demography and driving stress factors on the road. These findings motivate us to identify driving stress from physiological factors by developing a low-cost wearable, Stress Wear. This can detect stress from varying Heart Rates, validated by expensive commercial wearables. Between subject experiments on drivers (total n = 14 in two phases) with wearables, we also found that road factors are responsible for driving stress. Therefore, the developed system is helpful for these drivers to self-sense their stress.},

ZeCA runs as a smartphone background service and generates audio-visual alerts when the phone can distract the driver. A thorough evaluation and usability study of ZeCA with 50 different models of vehicles driven by 70 drivers over 5 countries indicates that the proposed solution can infer distracting smartphone interactions with  {\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}gt 80{\textbackslash}\% {\textbackslash})  accuracy and a  {\textbackslash}(70{\textbackslash}\% {\textbackslash})  reduction in smartphone usage during driving.},

This article explores this issue by presenting a study investigating variances in heart rate, heart rate variability, and skin conductance between socially anxious and non-anxious individuals. One hundred eleven non-clinical student participants participated in groups of three in three anxiety-provoking activities (i.e., speech, group discussion, and interview) in a controlled lab-based study. During the study, electrocardiogram (ECG) and electrodermal activity (EDA) signals were captured via on-body electrodes. During data analysis, participants were divided into four groups based on their self-reported anxiety level (“none,” “mild,” “moderate,” and “severe”). Between-group analysis shows that discriminating ECG features (i.e., heart rate and MeanNN) could identify anxious individuals during anxiety-provoking activities, while EDA could not. Moreover, the discriminating ECG features improved the classification accuracy of anxious and non-anxious individuals in different machine-learning techniques. The findings need to be further scrutinized in real-world settings for the generalizability of the results.},

	abstract = {This article argues that because the home is so familiar, it is necessary to make it strange, or defamiliarize it, in order to open its design space. Critical approaches to technology design are of both practical and social importance in the home. Home appliances are loaded with cultural associations such as the gendered division of domestic labor that are easy to overlook. Further, homes are not the same everywhere---even within a country. Peoples' aspirations and desires differ greatly across and between cultures. The target of western domestic technology design is often not the user, but the consumer. Web refrigerators that create shopping lists, garbage cans that let advertisers know what is thrown away, cabinets that monitor their contents and order more when supplies are low are central to current images of the wireless, digital home of the future. Drawing from our research in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Asia, we provide three different narratives of defamiliarization. A historical reading of American kitchens provides a lens with which to scrutinize new technologies of domesticity, an ethnographic account of an extended social unit in England problematizes taken-for-granted domestic technologies, and a comparative ethnography of the role of information and communication technologies in the daily lives of urban Asia's middle classes reveals the ways in which new technologies can be captured and domesticated in unexpected ways. In the final section of the article, we build on these moments of defamiliarization to suggest a broad set of challenges and strategies for design in the home.},

One possibility is to use stories, known as ‘Design Fiction,’ to help developers visualize different contexts and future use for their software. But such stories are themselves difficult to write. A recent pilot project investigated using a broad-brush threat model and fiction samples derived from existing science fiction literature to help developers create threat assessments for Health Internet-of-Things devices.
