Work & Description \\ \hline

\textit{Compass Table}, \newline A. Dunne \newline F. Raby &
``This table reminds you that electronic objects extend beyond their visible limits. The 25 compasses set into its surface twitch and spin when objects like mobile phones or laptop computers are placed on it. The twitching needles can be interpreted as being either sinister or charming, depending on the viewer's state of mind. When we designed the compass table, we wondered if a neat-freak might try to make all the needles line up, ignoring the architectural space of the room in favour of the Earth's magnetic field.'' Quoted from \cite{DuRa01}. \\ \hline

\textit{Life Counter}, \newline I. Matsumoto &
``With Life Counter (2001), you choose how many years you would like to or expect to live for and start the counter. Once activated, it counts down the selected time span at four different rates: the number of years, days, hours or seconds to go are shown on different faces. Depending on which face you choose to display, you may feel very relaxed as the years stretch out ahead or begin to panic as you see your life speed away before your eyes. The counter is designed to be visually unassuming and could easily fit into the slightly retro-futuristic style of the moment.'' Quoted from \cite{DuRa01}. \\ \hline

\textit{Open Informant}, \newline J Ardern \newline Y. Ushigome \newline A. Jain &
``Open Informant (2013) takes the form of a networked object including a phone app and e-ink badge. The app searches your communications for National Security Agency trigger words and then sends text fragments containing these words to the badge worn by the user for public display. Using the body as an instrument for protest, the badge becomes a means of rendering our own voice visible in an otherwise faceless technological panopticon.'' Quoted from \cite{Mal17}. \\ \hline
