Critical design is commonly attributed to Dunne and Raby~\cite{DuRa01,Dun05} however it can be seen has a refinement of earlier movements in arts and design, beginning with the Italian radical design movement and extending through critical practice in HCI~\cite{Mal17}. 

Consider the three examples provided in Table~\ref{tab:examples}. Each describes the design of an object or technology. In contrast to industrial design, these technologies are not meant for mass production. Rather they offer a subtle criticism by illustrating something---electromagnetic radiation, the inevitability of death, the ubiquity and stealth of surveillance---that typically goes unquestioned and/or creating a dilemma for the user.

Commonly, critical designs are either simply described or they are built and displayed (see relation to art below). In the case of Dunne and Raby's Compass Table (and seven other objects in their Placebo project), the table was built and given to individuals to use. This field study followed by an exit survey inquiring about how they felt about the object. In this paper, we describe our designs through short vignettes that illustrate its design and use case. With a good design, the reader should easily imagine its use in her life and question it critically, resulting in `rhetorical use'~\cite{Mal17} rather than practical use. Designs typically provoke the reader's emotions by invoking humour, satire, ridicule, poetry, playfulness, lewdness, appropriation, irreverence or deliberate overcompensation. We tag our own designs to distill out the intended mechanism.

\paragraph{Relation to Design.}

Much of design is oriented around problem-solving and the creation of functional, useful, and pleasurable solutions to practical problems. Critical design is about raising a question or communicating an idea.

\paragraph{Relation to Art.} 

Critical design has significant overlap with conceptual art, utilizing common methods, and has been disseminated through exhibitions and the art literature. However critical design works by showcasing things that are plausible, believable, and easy for the reader to situate---this requires the same design principles and methodologies as product design. Viewing critical design as art also creates challenges. Consider the compass table in the context of an art gallery exhibit---it is meant to illustrate EMR in every day life, in one's home, in different positions and orientations within that home---all of this is lost when it sits statically in a gallery. This can be compensated for through an accompanying vignette or film or narrative describing its context of use.

\paragraph{Relation to Science.} 

Critical design is ideological. But so is science. Even cryptography, positioned as one of the most scientifically rigorous pursuits in the field of security and privacy, is ideological, as argued eloquently by Rogaway in his recent essay~\cite{Rog15}. For example, he notes that work on bland-sounding subjects like differential privacy and identity-based encryption are premised on a certain world view --- respectively, one of massive data collection and government-escrowed master decryption keys. 

From a different angle, Herley and van Oorschot question which aspects of security, privacy, and cryptography are even a proper science~\cite{HvO17}. Critical design is not an objective form of design where success can be measured. We purposely do not set out to `measure' the success of our designs as this deeply misses the point of critical design. While our designs are for scientists, engineers, and technologists, it is not to establish theorems or facts but to raise questions.
