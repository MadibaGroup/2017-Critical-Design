In this paper, we investigate an alternative method for communicating the somewhat elusive security risks and privacy invasions of technology, the web, social networks, and other aspects of modern life. Specifically, we draw from the \textit{critical design} movement popularized by Dunne and Raby in the 90s. In this project, we have conceptualized 101 new technological designs and described their use through short vignettes. These designs are imaginary but plausible technologies that illustrate a security or privacy risk through absurdity, satire, or humour. We present a selection of them with remarks on their design.


- [ ] D\&R define affirming design and critical design. Affirming reinforces the direction of industry. Critical looks for alternatives 
- [ ] The issue, not the work or object or design itself, is key
