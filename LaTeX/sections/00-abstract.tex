In this paper, we investigate an alternative method for communicating the somewhat elusive risks and invasions of the security and privacy of technology, the web, social networks, and other aspects of modern life. Specifically, we draw from the \textit{critical design} movement popularized by Dunne and Raby in the 90s. In this project, we have conceptualized 101 new technological designs and described their use through short vignettes. These designs are of imaginary but plausible technologies that illustrate a security or privacy risk through absurdity, satire, or humour. We present a selection of them with remarks on their design.
